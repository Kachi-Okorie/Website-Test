      <strong>Alumni: Daniel Maddern</strong><br />
      <br />
       Graduating from Deakin University with a Bachelor of Computer Science, Daniel achieved a WAM of 93, securing High
      Distinctions in all subjects and reflecting his strong academic prowess. His engagement with Thoth Tech was
      instrumental in enhancing his professional skill set and preparing him for work post-university. Serving as a
      product lead for both Ontrack and the Art Gallery projects, and mentoring other senior students, he not only
      deepened his experience in Rails and Angular but also honed his leadership skills. His most significant technical
      contribution was the design and integration of a new feature for Ontrack, enabling seamless integration of Numbas
      testing within the system.<br />
      <br />
       In an effort to foster teamwork and connectivity, He spearheaded a company-wide team-building session at Thoth
      Tech to help students connect beyond their immediate teams, thereby promoting a cohesive and collaborative
      environment.
